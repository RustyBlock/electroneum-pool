<h3><a href="https://www.Nicehash.com" target="_blank">Nicehash</a> mining rules</h3>
<br/>
Dear Miners,<br/>
<br/>
RustyBlock pools are committed to accept any traffic that is compliant with Electroneum protocol. 
Our statistics are public and we are striving to promote equality and decentralization principles that 
are at heart of the generic cryptocurrency concept. We welcome all hardware, strong or weak, operated privately, rented from 
the cloud providers or elsewhere. This is why we are using <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_pool_reward_FAQ" target="_blank">proportional 
reward system</a> that, we believe, is the most fair and transparent choice.<br/>
<h4>RustyBlock approach</h4>
<p style="font-size:larger"><b style="color:blue;">To put it simply:</b> if miner is using <a href="https://www.Nicehash.com" target="_blank">Nicehash</a> with RustyBlock pools, they should stay connected and contributing 
until block is found otherwise they lose 50% of their shares.<br/>
</p>
Here's more details for the "mechanics". If miner is connected on port 28888 that is compatible with <a href="https://www.Nicehash.com" target="_blank">Nicehash</a>, pool is tracking the connection
and applies the following rules when block found and reward is being split between miners contributed their shares.
<ul>
 <li>If miner sent shares to port 28888, they are considered <a href="https://www.Nicehash.com" target="_blank">Nicehash</a> miner for the rest of the round.
     <ul>
         <li>Shares sent to other ports using same wallet address in the same round <b>will also be subject for this <a href="https://www.Nicehash.com" target="_blank">Nicehash</a> mining conditions</b>.</li>
         <li><i>We advise miners to use different wallet addresses for their <a href="https://www.Nicehash.com" target="_blank">Nicehash</a> connections so mining on CPU/GPU will not be considered <a href="https://www.Nicehash.com" target="_blank">Nicehash</a> traffic</i>.</li>
     </ul>
 </li>
 <li>When pool finds a block, it checks the timestamp of the last share sent by each <a href="https://www.Nicehash.com" target="_blank">Nicehash</a> miner.
     <ul>
         <li>If last share's timestamp is older than 1 minute, then total number of shares submitted by this miner is reduced by 50%.</li>
     </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<h4>Why are we doing this?</h4>
Unfortunately, proportional reward system has some specifics including its
vulnerability to the mining tactics known as "pool hopping". It's not easy to gain real benefits from the pool hopping
due to the various reasons but the idea seems tempting for many people in the mining community so they keep trying, 
e.g. <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2335622.0" target="_blank">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2335622.0</a><br/>
<br/>
Pool hopping isn't causing notable damage to the "loyal miners" of the pool <i>unless the hopper is using
services like <a href="https://www.Nicehash.com" target="_blank">Nicehash</a></i> that can send very high 
hashrate against the pool. This allows to accumulate a lot of shares on the hopper's account and get a 
large cut of the subsequent reward when other miners find a block. <a href="https://www.Nicehash.com" target="_blank">Nicehash</a> traffic is expensive so profitability of 
pool hopping with <a href="https://www.Nicehash.com" target="_blank">Nicehash</a> is questionable but reward deviation that it causes for small pools is too big to ignore.<br/>
