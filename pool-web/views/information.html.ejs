<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<h3>What is a mining pool?</h3>
<p>A mining pool is a way to mine cryptocurrency quicker by multiple miners working together rather than individually.
Normally, you would mine cryptocurrency from your own machine and it might take a while before you receive any currency as it might take a while before the calculations required to mine a block are completed.
What the mining pool does is distribute the processing power needed to mine each block.
This means that blocks can be mined quicker and the appropriate amount of currency is allocated depending on how much work your machine has put in.
</p>
<h3 class="float-right">Why RustyBlock pool?</h3><br /><br /><br/>
<p>There are multiple mining pools available (e.g. long list at <a href="https://miningpoolstats.stream/" target="_blank">https://miningpoolstats.stream/</a>),
    each with its pros and cons and the entire variety can be overwhelming. RustyBlock pool was created by the group of like-minded people who decided to combine
    their industry knowledge, extensive technical experience and, of course, their view of the future of cryptocurrencies, specifically <%= pool.currency.name %> - the new addition to the <a href="https://cryptonote.org/" target="_blank">CryptoNote family</a>,
    forked from the well-known and established <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero project</a>.
    Here are the thoughts that led us to starting our own pool:
    <ul>
        <li>None of us can sit and stare at the hashrate monitor all day so we need a <b>stable pool</b> that can almost "look after itself".</li>
        <li><%= pool.currency.name %> network is very busy with massive total hashrate that produces a block every two minutes or so. 
            We need very <b>efficient pool</b> to avoid wasting our hashing power.</li>
        <li>We need reward split mechanism that treats all miners as equal, regardless of the specific time of their contribution. Everyone on RustyBlock pool is rewarded 
            <b>proportionally to the amount of work they submitted at any time during a single round</b>. 
            If you want to disconnet due to personal reasons or even if you want to try mining on another pool, you are free to do so at any time. 
            RustyBlock pool will keep record of the shares you submitted and reward you whenever the block is found.</li>
        <li>It's <b>minimal pool fee</b> now and we can afford to keep it this way for some time.</li>
        <li>We believe in <b>personalized experience</b> and configurable features while most of the pools are very generic and static for each miner.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>What about pool fees?</h3>
<p>Running a mining pool isn't cheap, neither it's easy. It needs good hardware, fast networks and substantial amount of time for looking after it.
    Of course, we have to apply pool fee but we strife to keep it low while focusing more on adding new miners and increasing total pool hashrate to
            make better returns from the business of running the pool.</p>
<h3 class="float-right">Why registration process?</h3><br /><br /><br/>
<p class="alert alert-warning">RustyBlock doesn't collect or store personally identifiable information (PII) and if you register with an <b>email that has no PII</b> 
    associated with it, your experience can be considered completely anonymous.<br/>
    RustyBlock doesn't spam! We sent only one email to the users since December 2017 - to introduce <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=etn.rusty.block" target="_blank">mobile app</a> and switch of Electroneum network to ASIC mining.
</p><p>Our uniqie and personalized features such us hash rate change notifications and aggregated statistics for multiple workers under the same account,
     require registration and we want to ensure we have it from the start while improving our pool convenience for the registered users.</p>
